Currently I am a Sevice Operations Director for Capgemini's Cloud & Infrastructure Services (CIS).  I am operating in the role of Global Head of Delivery Modernization.  As I assist in strategic transformation of the business, I am available for questions or insights via the links available below.

In former roles I was:
- ***Director of Engineering*** for Digital Workforce at Gainwell Technologies LLC, where I lead a team of several in removing toil from the daily grind by securely automating many traditional tasks which #intelligentAutomation can address today.
- ***Sr Manager*** and Global Head of DXC Technology's, Security Engineering & Architecture organization, moving them towards a more DevSecOps model of engagement using Agile methods and adopting common key principles of API First, and Security First. I had been responsible for increasing observability and measurability of security outcomes for Delivery, and my team developed for our security portfolio offerings and platform, operated in and supported public cloud security, and accelerated corporate change by becoming an enabler.
- Master Level Technology Honors Recipient in 2018 for DXC Technology as ***Chief Engineer*** for Business Process & Appication Services - supporting all service lines under DXC Bionix sub-brand, with Lean, Six Sigma and Analytics driven automation efficiencies.

Other former roles, all pre-merger (EDS, HP, HPE) I was responsible for Applications, Business Process Services, and Industry Software & Solutions improvements, holding significant experience in Travel Transportation & Hospitality, Healthcare & Life Sciences, and Aerospace & Defense industry segments.

Continuing as a seasoned architect and engineer, I have always addressed multiple scopes (Enterprise, Process, Solution, & Technical) carrying broad experience in infrastructure, applications, and business process automation technologies.  I have been trusted to address multiple regulatory controls and management of transformations underpinned by ITAR/DFARS/FISMA/FedRAMP/CMMC, SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, PA-DSS, and GDPR.  I still practice application design, development, and deployment while applying DevOps or DevSecOps as our focus of culture change.
