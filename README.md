As a **Sevice Operations Director** for Capgemini's Cloud & Infrastructure Services (CIS), I serve as the **CIS Chief Engineer** globally.  I assist in strategic transformation of the business, leadership over the engineering activities and outcomes, and assist in the innovation of our services.

In former roles I was:
- ***Director of Engineering*** for Digital Workforce at Gainwell Technologies, where I lead a team of several in removing toil from the daily grind by securely automating many traditional tasks which #intelligentAutomation can address today.
- ***Sr Manager*** and Global Head of DXC Technology's, Security Engineering & Architecture organization, moving them towards a more DevSecOps model of engagement using Agile methods and adopting common key principles of API First, and Security First. I had been responsible for increasing observability and measurability of security outcomes for Delivery, and my team developed for our security portfolio offerings and platform, operated in and supported public cloud security, and accelerated corporate change by becoming an enabler.
- Master Level Technology Honors Recipient in 2018 for DXC Technology as ***Chief Engineer*** for Business Process & Appication Services - supporting all service lines under DXC Bionix sub-brand, with Lean, Six Sigma and Analytics driven automation efficiencies.

Other former roles, all pre-merger (EDS, HP, HPE) I was responsible for Applications, Business Process Services, and Industry Software & Solutions improvements, holding significant experience in Travel Transportation & Hospitality, Healthcare & Life Sciences, and Aerospace & Defense industry segments.  Significant four-wall experiences (>2 years) were with American Airlines, Conway (now XPO), Talisman Energy, Sun Microsystems, Xerox, and Eastman Kodak.  Large Merger Acquisition and Divestiture experiences with (Kraft Cadbury Mondelez), (American Airlines, US Airways), and (Abbott, AbbVie).  Likewise I have maintained multiple visas in several countries in support of many business outcomes.

Continuing as a seasoned architect and engineer, I have addressed multiple scopes (Enterprise, Process, Solution, & Technical) carrying broad experience in infrastructure, applications, and business process automation technologies.  I continue to be trusted with management of multiple regulatory controls and transformations underpinned more specifically by ITAR, DFARS, FISMA, FedRAMP, CMMC, SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, PA-DSS, and GDPR.  Recently I have begun broader exposure and experience in DORA, and am expanding in data sovereignty, residency, and privacy controls across the Middle East, India, and Asia.  I still actively practice application design, development, and deployment while applying DevOps or DevSecOps as our focus of culture change.
